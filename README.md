This is an extension for vscode. It allows you to

* Save groups of tabs
* Restore groups of tabs

# Usage

You can open the command pallette and search "save tab group", "save tab group and close all tabs", "restore tab group" or "restore tab group and close all others". If you type the same name for a tab group it will ask you if you want to overwrite the previous one. You can also do "update tab group" to overwrite a specific tab group or "update last used tab group" to overwrite without asking.

# Contributions

Thanks to [eamodio](https://github.com/eamodio) for the code to cycle through tabs
